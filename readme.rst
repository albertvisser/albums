Albums

is the latest stage in the evolution of my take on
"build an application to administer your record collection".

It is a webapp in which you can enter and edit data about albums and concerts that you bought or
recorded on various types of media.

Usage
-----

Use manage.py or the provided fcgi or wsgi script to start the django app, and
configure your web server to communicate with it (see examples).


Requirements
------------

- Python
- Django
- jQuery (download recent version into /static/)
